     <h1>PC vs Mac</h1>
     <section>
        
      <h2>PC - Philip Wood</h2>
      <p>I've always thought that PCs were far better then Macs, and still my opinion hasn't changed.<br>
        PCs are much better then Macs when it comes to playing video games. I also find I have alot more<br>
        freedom on a PC vs a Mac. My opinion can be quite biased though, because I've only ever used PCs <br>
        and would always shun Macs. Also, the price difference between a Mac and a PC is crazy. A Macbook<br>
        can cost you anywhere from $2000-$4000, where I could build an amazing PC for only $1500-$2000. With<br>
        that being said, PCs are alot more customizable, being able to switch out parts for newer upgrades.<br>
        Where the Mac I'm currently working on has everything built into the monitor, good luck customizing that.<br>
        With that being said, I will always love my PCs, and will most likely always hate Macs.</p>

      <h2>Mac - James Pratt</h2>
      <img src="images/mac.jpg" alt="Mac" width="500" height="200"><br>
      <p>Mac dominates PC in all aspect of computing. Without a doubt Mac could wipe the <br>
        floor with PC. From a cleaner operating system, to better UX and of course better <br>
        security, Mac is years ahead of any PC. With PC, the chances of aquiring a virus <br>
        skyrockets with every link you click. While PC may make the argument that you can <br>
        more smoothly, who needs to waste time gaming when you could be doing more work! <br>
        So finally I leave you with one last comment... Just put the glorified coffee <br>
        table in the trash. </p>
