      <h2>PC</h2>
      <p>I've always thought that PCs were far better then Macs, and still my opinion hasn't changed. PCs are much better then Macs when it comes to playing video games. I also find I have alot more freedom on a PC vs a Mac. My opinion can be quite biased though, because I've only ever used PCs and would always shun Macs. Also, the price difference between a Mac and a PC is crazy. A Macbook can cost you anywhere from $2000-$4000, where I could build an amazing PC for only $1500-$2000. With that being said, PCs are alot more customizable, being able to switch out parts for newer upgrades. Where the Mac I'm currently working on has everything built into the monitor, good luck customizing that.</p>
