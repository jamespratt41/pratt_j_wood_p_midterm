    <h1>Mac vs PC</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>Mac</h2>
      <img src="images/mac.jpg" alt="Mac" width="500" height="200"><br>
      <p>Mac dominates PC in all aspect of computing. Without a doubt Mac could wipe the <br>
        floor with PC. From a cleaner operating system, to better UX and of course better <br>
        security, Mac is years ahead of any PC. With PC, the chances of aquiring a virus <br>
        skyrockets with every link you click. While PC may make the argument that you can <br>
        more smoothly, who needs to waste time gaming when you could be doing more work! <br>
        So finally I leave you with one last comment... Just put the glorified coffee <br>
        table in the trash. </p>
